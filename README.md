# 16-bit CPU Simulator

This is a fully functional 16-bit CPU Simulator with an interactive command line interface and an assembly-to-memory parser.

This project is based off of the Albacore processor outlined in ***Practical Logic and Processor Design with Verilog*** written by ***Jay Brockman***

## Usage

To create a memory file based off an assembly program, run the command:
`./asm2mem [input asm file] [output mem file]`

To simulate a program:
`./simulate_cpu [mem file]`
